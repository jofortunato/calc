# Calculator Coding Challenge

## Requirements
Create a program that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. For example, on input **3+(5+(4*3))-12**, the program should return **8**. The program should also detect an invalid input and report an appropriate error.

**Supported Symbols**
- Positive and negative numbers.
- +, -, *, / and parentheses.

## Current Version
- Calculates arithmetic expressions: converts usual infix notation expression to postfix notation using The Shunting Yard Algorithm (http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/shuntingYardAlgorithm/);
- Detection of invalid inputs not implemented.
